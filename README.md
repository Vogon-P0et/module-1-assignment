# Starting Your Codewars Journey

#### The aim of the assignment was to train on our first CodeWars katas. We were given three simple katas to complete. Please see the python code in this repository for more comments on the assignment.

In the assignment file, you will see that the functions have been created for you with return statements. If you would like to test various arguments when calling the function, please change the value of the "test" variable for each problem to reflect the desired input.

#### Below you will find the instructions directly from CodeWars for the assignment:


##### Problem 1 Description:
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

##### Problem 2 Description:
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

##### Problem 3 Description
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
